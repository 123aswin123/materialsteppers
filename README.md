`compile 'ivb.com.materialstepper:material-stepper:0.0.2'`
<br />
<br />
1. Create Java Class and Extend **progressMobileStepper** or **simpleMobileStepper** Activity.<br/>
2. Implement Methods **List<Class> init()** method and **void onStepperCompleted()** .<br />
3. Create Fragments by Extending **stepperFragment** and implement Method **boolean onNextButtonHandler()**.<br/>
4. Use **onNextButtonHandler** method to handle UI validation inside Fragments,whenever the user presses the Next Button,return true/false inorder to determine to Stay or move to next Fragment.<br/>
5. Make it as ArrayList with Class containing fragments and return via **List<Class> init()** method - Mentioned in 1st point.<br/>
6. use **onStepperCompleted** method to complete stepper and finalize the activity.
7. It's upto Developer to use savedInstanceState to save the Data since the fragments will be initialized only when needed,At most of the time it will be destroyed.(To Avoid Memory Overhead and Leaks).

<hr>
**Note** : with the given List size : step count will be Computed and Updated,Increasing and dynamic fragment feature may be added in future Commits,<br>
Scrollview have been adopted for ViewPager(fragment) inbuilt to scroll,So no worries for small/Large Screens.Added support for both Landscape and Portait Mode by adopting SavedInstanceState.(However Your Data inside fragment is not gauranteed so,use SavedinstanceState)
